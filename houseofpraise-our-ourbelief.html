        <p class="op-description">Pastors Yinka & Amaka Adepoju
            are servant leaders who inspire the church and show 
            the love of God in all they do. </br></br>
            Pastor Yinka trained as a Mechanical Engineer in Africa but his love for 
            the kingdom singled him out and was ordained in 2002, 
            just two years after being married to Pst Amaka. 
            They began pastoring since year 2003 and their ministry 
            over the years have seen them mentoring and training 
            many kingdom soldiers. </br> </br>They have both been in active 
            ministry since then and have enjoyed about 20 years of 
            marriage together. They have 3 grown children - a 
            daughter-and 2 sons. Pastor Yinka and Amaka are 
            passionate in helping people have a relationship 
            with Jesus Christ and love to help people live, 
            learn and love God in the way that the Holy Bible instructs.

        <p class="ou-title">WHO WE ARE</p>
        <p class="ou-subtitle">VICTORS & CONQUERORS</p>
        <p class="church-description">Began meeting in nondescript places 
          since 2009 and we were inaugurated in 2011. 
          By God's grace, we have seen God prove His word 
          to us that the gates of hell cannot prevail over 
          His church all these years. </br> </br>

          From day one, we have been a church community 
          that is committed to growing in our faith and 
          in our relationships with one another. We have
            taken Jesus' command to "be known by our love
            for one another" to heart. We know this is 
            why so many of our people feel at home when 
            they gather together.</br></br>

          
          We are family, and we think that's how a church 
          should be. One of the distinct things about our 
          church community is that we are a multi-generational 
          and multi-cultural assemblage of true worshipers of 
          the Almighty God.

          <p class="ob-title">WE BELIEVE</p>
          <p class="belief-description">
            We believe that The Holy Bible is the written and revealed Will of God.
            We believe that the entire Scripture, both Old and New Testament are 
            written by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. All the Christian 
            teachings and the Christian attitude of the Children of God are such 
            as are established in the Holy Bible. <br><br>As revealed unto us by the 
            Bible, we believe that there is only one God, who is the Creator 
            of both the visible and invisible. He exists in three Persons: 
            God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. <br><br>
            We believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God; Who took away our sins, 
            and the Saviour of the world. We also believe that Jesus is God 
            and was born by Mary the Virgin. He is God revealed in the flesh. 
            Through Him all things were created. We believe in His death on 
            the Cross, and resurrection, by which He brought redemption.<br><br> 
            We believe in Water Baptism by the Name of the Father, Son and Holy 
            Spirit. It is an outward sign, an example of a true repentance of a 
            sinner from his or her sins. <br><br>We believe in the infilling and power 
            of the Holy Spirt. The holy spirit enables us to use spiritual gifts, 
            including speaking in tongues. <br><br>
            We believe in The Second coming of Jesus Christ will be in physical 
            form and will be visible to all. <br><br>
            We believe that Sunday is a special day whereby believers should 
            separate as the Lord’s day during which time they are to gather to 
            worship. <br><br>
            We believe in Heaven & Hell. The Bible teaches us that there is 
            eternal punishment as well as eternal life. <br><br> 
            We believe that God wants us to live a life full of purpose, 
            abundance, health and transformation.
